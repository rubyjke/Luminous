# Luminous 
A mini drone for light painting. Design your light path at [website domain], set up your camera, and let the drone do the rest.

## What's light painting? 
Light painting is a photographic technique that uses a moving light source (our drone) to *paint* over a scene while taking a long exposure photograph. A few couple of the photo effect this produces:

## Why did we make Luminous?
Light painting can be tricky, especially when you're doing it alone. You need to finish the *painting* in a set amount of time it can take quite a few takes to get the exact result you want. We wanted to find a way to address this and realized that an autnomous phone paired with path design software could allow for custom light paths to be made and executed effortlessly.
The project also combined our hobbies: art, photogrphy, and drone design.

### Disclaimer 
We fried our sensor so our drone can't map the path autonomously, however we're pretty confident that if you build a replica with a working sensor that it'll work just fine!
